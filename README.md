# Fancy login

This is a login + registration view interaction build with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). The view is displayed like a stack with a login form on the front and a registration form on the back. You can see a preview of the project [here](https://chrkirk.github.io/fancy_login/).

Features:
* Password inputs have a visibility switch.
* When a form button is pressed if there are empty fields an error message will appear.
